                                      An image histogram is a type of histogram that acts as a graphical representation of the tonal
                                      distribution in a digital image. It plots the number of pixels for each tonal value. By looking at the histogram for
                                      a specific image a viewer will be able to judge the entire tonal distribution at a glance.\n\n
                                      Image histograms are present on many modern digital cameras. Photographers can use them as an aid to show the
                                      distribution of tones captured, and whether image detail has been lost to blown-out highlights or blacked-out
                                      shadows\n\n
                                      The horizontal axis of the graph represents the tonal variations, while the vertical axis represents
                                      the number of pixels in that particular tone. The left side of the horizontal axis represents the black
                                      and dark areas, the middle represents medium grey and the right hand
                                      side represents light and pure white areas. \n\n
                                       1. Too dark\n 2. A little dark\n 3. Good expose\n 4. A little light\n 5. Too light</string>
